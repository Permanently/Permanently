### hey!
my name is permanently ([he/his](https://pronoun.is/he)), however some of you may know me as perm, billy, or dog. i'm a 18-year-old student based in leeds currently studying a-levels, mainly computer science. hoping to go into cybersec at some point in time, but until then i'm just messing around with code and seeing what i can (and can't) do!

### what are your current aims right now?
my main focus are my qualifications right now, but when i do find any spare time i usually work on other random projects. nothing in particular, for now.

### where can i find more of you?
good question, person who would never ask that! you can usually find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/heyiambilly). (if i don't get suspended for the eigth time, and when i do i'll update this)

if you're looking to contact me for any formal reasons, you'd be better contacting me via email. good thing it shows on my profile, right?
