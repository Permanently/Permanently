### hey!
my name is permanently ([he/his](https://pronoun.is/he)), however some of you may know me as perm, billy, or dog. i'm a student currently studying a-levels, mainly computer science. hoping to go into cybersec at some point in time, but until then i'm just messing around with code and seeing what i can (and can't) do!

### what are your current aims right now?
my main focus are my qualifications right now, but when i do find any spare time i usually work on other random projects. i'm trying to pick up java (helps that i know a fair amount of c#) and hope to learn more of it.

if you're looking to contact me for any formal reasons, you'd be better contacting me via email. good thing it shows on my profile, right?
