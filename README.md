### hey!
my name is permanently ([he/him](https://pronoun.is/he)), however some of you may know me as perm, or billy. i'm a student currently studying a-levels, mainly computer science. i'd love to go into software development or cybersec, but until then i'm just messing around with code and seeing what i can (and can't) do!

### what are your current aims right now?
my main focus are my qualifications right now, but when i do find any spare time i usually work on other random projects such as [Pharmer](https://github.com/Permanently/Pharmer). i'm trying to pick up java and hope to learn more of it, and am also trying out nodejs for a college project as well as a few other small projects here and there. i have a fair grip of c#, and have been programming with it for the past two years in college. when will i put that to use on here? who knows!

### where can i talk to you?
if you're looking to contact me for any formal reasons, you'd be better contacting me via email. good thing it shows on my profile, right? you could also try me through [twitter](https://twitter.com/permanentlay), but don't rely on it, considering i get suspended real quick.
